# Big Mart Sales Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts sales for Big Mart retail outlets using machine learning. The XGBoost regressor model analyzes product and store characteristics to forecast sales performance.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains 8,523 product sales records across multiple Big Mart outlets with 12 features including:
- Product details (weight, fat content, visibility, type, price)
- Store characteristics (size, location, type, establishment year)
- Target variable: Item_Outlet_Sales

## 🔧 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values for Item_Weight (mean imputation) and Outlet_Size (mode imputation)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Standardized categorical values and applied label encoding
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized distributions and relationships in the data
4. **Model Building**: Trained XGBoost regressor with 80-20 train-test split
5. **Evaluation**: Achieved R² score of 0.876 (train) and 0.502 (test)
